      Here are the steps to use the touch typing app: <br/><br/>

1. Open the touch typing application in your web browser.<br/>

2. You will see a keyboard layout displayed on the screen, highlighting the keys you need to type (a, s, d, f, j, k, l, and ;).<br/>

3. Below the keyboard layout, you will find a text input area.<br/>

4. To start practicing, click on the text input area and begin typing the keys shown on the keyboard layout. The keys you type will appear in the text input area.<br/>

5. As you type, the application will provide immediate feedback on the correctness of your keystrokes. Incorrect keystrokes may be visually highlighted or indicated in some way.<br/>

6. You can continue typing for as long as you like. The application will keep track of your typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy percentage.<br/>

7. To stop the practice session, click the "Stop Practice" button. The application will calculate your final typing speed and accuracy based on the number of keys you typed correctly during the practice session.<br/>

8. After stopping the practice session, you can start a new practice session by clicking the "Start Practice" button again.<br/>

9. The progress tracker section will display your typing speed (in words per minute) and accuracy percentage. This will provide you with feedback on your performance.<br/>

10. You can customize certain aspects of the application by accessing the settings, such as adjusting the keyboard layout colors or other preferences. Look for a settings option or button within the application.<br/>

11. You can continue to practice and track your progress over time to improve your touch typing skills.<br/><br/><br/>
