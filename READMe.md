Steps to build the app detailed below--

To set up the touch typing app, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Create a new directory for your touch typing app project.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Initialize a new React project using Create React App by running the following command:
```
npx create-react-app touch-typing-app
```

5. Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:
```
cd touch-typing-app
```

6. Replace the default files in the `src` folder with the following files:
   - `App.js`
   - `KeyboardLayout.js`
   - `TextInput.js`
   - `ProgressTracker.js`

7. Create CSS files for the components in the `src` folder:
   - `KeyboardLayout.css`
   - `TextInput.css`
   - `ProgressTracker.css`

8. Install any required dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:
```
npm install react-router-dom
```
   - This installs the `react-router-dom` package for handling routing in the app.

9. Start the development server by running the following command:
```
npm start
```

10. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the touch typing app in action.

11. You can now use the touch typing app by following the steps outlined in the previous response.
